# Password Manager

I'm just shoving this README here so that we have something there. This has the rules for the repository and the things everyone needs to do this week

## Team rules for github-ing
* Make sure you always clone the latest version of the master branch 
* Have your own branch for working on your thing
* Meet every Friday to merge the branches and can't leave until there are no conflicts
Don't wait for someone else to finish if you need specific variable name. Just make own variable names and we work all the stuff out on Friday

## Tasks (by friday 8th)
* Vilius - database integration (https://netbeans.org/features/ide/database.html) 
* Jack - Register/Login (Hashing of passwords)
* Ryan - Password generator
* Josh - UI
* Alex - Entry Manager
* Kamil - Encryption
